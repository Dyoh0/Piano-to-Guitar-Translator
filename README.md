Sometimes, I'll listen to some nice piano music and think 'This is simple and fun enough that I want to play it on the guitar...if only it was on the guitar.'  And there's no piano to guitar auto-translator online other than some super helpful charts, but they overwhelm me and I wanted something like a site that actually takes in piano inputs and translates them to guitar.  And then I realized, "Wait.  I JUST took a webdev class.  I could probably make this myself."

The 'Delete Last Tab' button is meant to be used with the 'Undo' button!  If you need to undo enough notes that you need to go back to the previous board, 'Undo' won't let you until you delete that last board.
